// Remove the entire FacilitySearch class and its initialization.
// The location search logic is now managed directly within survey_page.php.

// (These are currently being fetched via direct fetch calls, not through FacilitySearch)

    // Service units and ownership options are now loaded directly in survey_page.php

    // Removed the old window.validateForm here. The validation is now handled in survey_page.php's script block.
    // Removed window.toggleDemographics as its section is not in survey_page.php HTML.
    // Removed window.printForm as its section is not in survey_page.php HTML.
    // Removed old loadServiceUnits() and loadOwnershipOptions() calls, as the fetch calls above handle it directly.

});

// Important Note: The main pagination logic, location search behavior,
// and form submission validation are now managed directly within the <script>
// tags of survey_page.php itself. This file (survey_page.js) should only
// contain supplementary, non-conflicting JavaScript.
